# Bon Jovi – イッツ・マイ・ライフ

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
this ain't a song for the
broken hearted
no silent prayer for
faith departed
and I ain't gonna be
just a face in the crowd
you're gonna hear my voice
when I shout it out loud
it's my life it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while
I'm alive (it's my life)
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
I did itmy way
I just wanna live while
I'm alive
it's my life
<♪>
this is for theones
who stood their ground
for tommy and gina
who never backed down
tomorrow's getting harder
make no mistake
luck ain't even lucky
got to make your own breaks
it's my life it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while
I'm alive (it's my life)
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
I did itmy way
I just wanna live while
I'm alive
it's my life
<♪>
better stand tall when
they're calling you out
don't bend, don't break
baby don't back down
it's my life it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while
I'm alive (it's my life)
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
I did itmy way
I just wanna live while
I'm alive
it's my life it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while
I'm alive (it's my life)
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
I did itmy way
I just wanna live while
I'm alive
it's my life
